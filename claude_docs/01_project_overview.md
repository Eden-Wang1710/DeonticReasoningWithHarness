## What this is

My **master's thesis**: improving LLM **deontic reasoning** — answering questions by applying
explicit rules and policies (statutes, contracts, regulations) to case-specific facts.

The starting point is two consecutive papers by **Guangyao Dou** (JHU, Van Durme group), a senior
PhD student in the group. Both codebases are vendored into this repo:

| | Work | Setup | Path here |
|---|---|---|---|
| ① | **DeonticBench** (arXiv 2604.04443) | The benchmark. Statute goes in the prompt; the model emits an answer or a Prolog program in **one shot**; an external runner executes the Prolog and scores it. | `DeonticBench/` |
| ② | **DAR: Deontic Reasoning with Agentic Harnesses** (arXiv 2606.05009) | Makes ① **agentic**. The statute is a *file* in a container; the agent reads/greps it on demand and can run `swipl` itself, iterating over multiple turns. | `harbor-deonticbench/` |

②'s headline finding: agentic harnesses can push the frontier, **but gains are not uniform** —
weaker models often *degrade* on numerical tasks while consuming far more tokens.

## What the thesis does

**Improve on ① and ②.** The specific direction has not yet been narrowed to one. Candidate
directions, the evidence behind each, and the trade-offs are tracked in
[05_thesis_directions.md](05_thesis_directions.md), which doubles as the decision log. Once a
direction is fixed, this section becomes a one-line thesis statement.

The candidates are grounded in two close-reading notes — currently this project's most valuable
asset:

- [03_deonticbench_review.md](03_deonticbench_review.md) — ①: paper, code and data
- [04_dar_review.md](04_dar_review.md) — ②: paper and code

Everything marked ✅ in those notes (reference Prolog written against the answer key; Airline
few-shot exemplars drawn from the test set itself; the released scorer not reproducing the
published metric; the two papers scoring numeric answers differently; DAR's two custom agents
missing from the released code) is a **concrete entry point for improvement**, not a complaint.
This is in-group work — the author is reachable, and missing pieces can simply be asked for.

## Repo layout

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | Short English pointer for the GitHub landing page. |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Context auto-loaded by Claude Code: index of `claude_docs/` plus the easy-to-get-wrong list. |
| `claude_docs/` | All project documentation, numbered `NN_snake_case.md`. |
| `DeonticBench/` | ①'s upstream code (scripts, `hard` / `smoke` data, statutes, prompts). **git subtree** (`guangyaodou/DeonticBench` @ `3c168f9`, squashed). Plain files; editing them is fine. |
| `harbor-deonticbench/` | ②'s upstream code (Harbor 0.3.0 + meta-harness + DeonticBench adapters + scorer). **git subtree** (`guangyaodou/harbor-deonticbench` @ `2fe3aa4`, squashed, vendored 2026-09-17). Apache-2.0. |

Only `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` live at the repo root (GitHub renders the first on the landing
page; Claude Code auto-loads the second only from the root). Every other doc goes in `claude_docs/`.

Where my own code will live is decided once the direction is fixed (see `05`). The rule is: keep it
**out of the two subtree directories**, or every future `git subtree pull` will conflict.

## Visibility

This repo stays **private**, for two reasons:

1. `guangyaodou/DeonticBench` ships no LICENSE file (only the HF dataset is explicitly CC-BY-4.0).
   `harbor-deonticbench` is Apache-2.0, which does not change the conclusion for the repo as a whole.
2. It also holds my own unfinished thesis work.

Licensing is a question to put directly to the author — this is in-group code, not an arm's-length
upstream.
