The relevant statute is available at `/app/statute.txt`.
Example Prolog solutions for similar problems are available at `/app/examples.txt`.


**Case Facts:**
Karen is a Business Class passenger flying from Miami to Montreal with the following items: 1. A backpack: 18 x 12 x 7 inches, 7 lbs; 2. A backpack: 39 x 17 x 13 inches, 67 lbs; 3. A luggage box: 34 x 22 x 9 inches, 54 lbs; 4. A backpack: 38 x 16 x 10 inches, 53 lbs; 5. A luggage box: 36 x 20 x 9 inches, 95 lbs; Karen's flight ticket is $181.


**Question:**
What is the total cost (including the flight ticket fee, checked bag fees, cost of special needs) according to the policies for the passenger?

Review the examples in `/app/examples.txt` to understand the expected Prolog structure,
then write a complete, runnable SWI-Prolog program at `/app/solution.pl` that:
1. Encodes the relevant rules from the statute as Prolog clauses
2. Encodes the case facts as Prolog facts
3. Derives the answer to the question
4. Prints the answer on a single line in exactly this format: `Answer: <value>`
5. Calls `:- halt.`

**Use `swipl` to verify your program as you go:**
```
swipl -q -f /app/solution.pl
```
Check the output for syntax errors or warnings. If any errors appear, fix them and re-run until the program executes cleanly and prints the expected `Answer:` line.

The answer is a whole number (total cost in dollars, no $ sign). E.g., `Answer: 1166`

The task is complete once `swipl -q -f /app/solution.pl` runs without errors and prints the `Answer:` line.
