The relevant statute is available at `/app/statute.txt`.


**Case Facts:**
Alice has a son, Bob. From September 1st, 2015 to November 3rd, 2019, Alice and Bob lived in the same home. Bob married Charlie on October 23rd, 2018. Bob satisfied section 152(c)(2) and 152(c)(3) with Alice as the taxpayer for the years 2015 to 2020.


**Question:**
Under section 152(c)(1), Bob is a qualifying child of Alice for the year 2019.

Write a complete, runnable SWI-Prolog program at `/app/solution.pl` that:
1. Encodes the relevant rules from the statute as Prolog clauses
2. Encodes the case facts as Prolog facts
3. Derives the answer to the question
4. Prints the answer on a single line in exactly this format: `Answer: <value>`
5. Calls `:- halt.`

**Use `swipl` to verify your program as you go:**
```
swipl -q -f /app/solution.pl
```
Check the output for syntax errors or warnings. If any errors appear, fix them and re-run until the program executes cleanly and prints the expected `Answer:` line.

The answer is exactly "Entailment" (the claim is true given the statute and facts) or "Contradiction" (the claim is false). E.g., `Answer: Entailment`

The task is complete once `swipl -q -f /app/solution.pl` runs without errors and prints the `Answer:` line.
