# DeonticReasoningWithHarness

Master's thesis work on **deontic reasoning** with LLMs — answering questions by applying explicit
rules and policies (statutes, contracts, regulations) to case-specific facts.

Built on two papers by Guangyao Dou (JHU, Van Durme group), both vendored here as git subtrees:

- **DeonticBench** ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.04443) · [code](https://github.com/guangyaodou/DeonticBench) · [data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/gydou/DeonticBench)) — the benchmark: statute in the prompt, one-shot answer or Prolog program.
- **DAR: Deontic Reasoning with Agentic Harnesses** ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.05009) · [code](https://github.com/guangyaodou/harbor-deonticbench)) — the agentic follow-up: the statute is a file in a container and the agent reads it on demand.

Private repo: `DeonticBench` ships no LICENSE file, and this also holds unpublished thesis work.
(`harbor-deonticbench` is Apache-2.0, but that does not make the repo as a whole redistributable.)
