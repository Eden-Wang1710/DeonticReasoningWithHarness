The relevant statute is available at `/app/statute.txt`.
Example Prolog solutions for similar problems are available at `/app/examples.txt`.


**Case Facts:**
Alice has a son, Bob, who satisfies section 152(c)(1) for the year 2015.


**Question:**
Under section 152(a), Bob is a dependent of Alice for the year 2015.

Review the examples in `/app/examples.txt` to understand the expected Prolog structure,
then write a complete, runnable SWI-Prolog program at `/app/solution.pl` that:
1. Encodes the relevant rules from the statute as Prolog clauses
2. Encodes the case facts as Prolog facts
3. Derives the answer to the question
4. Prints the answer on a single line in exactly this format: `Answer: <value>`
5. Calls `:- halt.`

**Use `swipl` to verify your program as you go:**
```
swipl -q -f /app/solution.pl
```
Check the output for syntax errors or warnings. If any errors appear, fix them and re-run until the program executes cleanly and prints the expected `Answer:` line.

The answer is exactly "Entailment" (the claim is true given the statute and facts) or "Contradiction" (the claim is false). E.g., `Answer: Entailment`

The task is complete once `swipl -q -f /app/solution.pl` runs without errors and prints the `Answer:` line.
